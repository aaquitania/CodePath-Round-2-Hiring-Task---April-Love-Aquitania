# Scenario D

Hi Dennis,

We would like to congratulate you on your internship with Microsoft!

We are acknowledging your request to be moved to an observer role. As a CodePath
Android Course observer:

1.  You will have a liftime access to CodePath Android Course material and you
    can study it at your own pace.

2.  There won't be due dates or any expectations of observers imposed by us.

3.  We want to invite you to join our [mailing
    list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) to receive
    updates on upcoming courses and events.

We wish you luck with all your endeavours and success!

All the best,

CodePath.org Team
